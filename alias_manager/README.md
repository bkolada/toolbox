# Alias manager

## Purpose
In daily basis I often use and create aliases. I really don't want to use `alias` command because there are a lot of other aliases, provided by ZSH or/and prezto. That's why I've created following fairly simple script which manage aliases stored in `~/.zshaliases`.

## Instalation
 todo

## Usage
Just run mali it prints all possible usages.
