# Alias manager

## Purpose
In daily basis I often use and create aliases. I keept my own aliases in file:
`~/.zshaliases` and mentained that by hand. To see what aliases I have defined I had to type `cat ~/.zshaliases` so it wasn't that user friendly as it supposed to be. So the idea behind was to create simple manager for aliases, something that will always use predefined file, will be able to add, remove, search for aliases and so on.
