## WTF is that?
... my scripts I usually use!

## Package include
* Alias manager - cmd tool to maintain aliases.

## Installation

Just run following commands:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bkolada/toolbox.git "$HOME/.toolbox"

$HOME/.toolbox/installation.sh
```

First will copy remote directory with all tools into `$home/.toolbox` dir.
Second one will create all necessary soft links.
